# KRCT Social Website

KRCT Social is a modern, responsive web application designed for social interaction. Built with React, TypeScript, and styled using TailwindCSS, the project leverages the power of Firebase for backend functionality. Currently, the project is under development and is missing a complete backend system.

## Project Status

- **Under Development**: The project is still in progress and requires additional features and backend integration.
- **Backend Missing**: The current implementation does not include a functional backend, which is necessary for data storage, user authentication, and more.

## Features

- Built with **React** and **TypeScript** for a strong, scalable front-end.
- **TailwindCSS** for efficient styling and a clean UI.
- Firebase integration for user authentication (incomplete).
- Modular components and pages for scalability.

## Development Needs

- **Backend**: A full backend implementation is required. We plan to use Firebase or other services for authentication and data storage.
- **Feature Enhancements**: Some pages are placeholders and will need to be developed further.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Testing and improvements for responsiveness and user experience.

Project Title: KRCT Social (React + TypeScript Frontend)
Description: KRCT Social is a React and TypeScript-based front-end application built using the Vite build tool and styled with TailwindCSS. This project is designed with modular components and pages, making it scalable and easy to maintain. The project integrates Firebase for backend services, although its implementation is incomplete.

Current Status:
This project is in development and requires significant improvements, particularly in the following areas:

Backend Development: Currently lacks a robust backend implementation for data handling, authentication, and APIs.
Feature Enhancements: Some pages and components are placeholders and need further functionality.
Testing and Optimization: Needs thorough testing and optimization for better performance.
Features:
Modern front-end built with React and TypeScript.
TailwindCSS integration for efficient styling.
Vite as the build tool for fast development.
Future Development Needs:
A functional backend system (Node.js, Django, or similar) for seamless data integration.
Advanced user authentication and database features using Firebase or other platforms.
Additional UI/UX improvements and responsiveness testing.
