# KRCT Social

KRCT Social is a React and TypeScript-based front-end application built using the Vite build tool and styled with TailwindCSS. This project is designed with modular components and pages, making it scalable and easy to maintain. The project integrates Firebase for backend services, although its implementation is incomplete.

## Project Status
This project is in development and requires significant improvements, particularly in the following areas:

- **Backend Development**: Currently lacks a robust backend implementation for data handling, authentication, and APIs.
- **Feature Enhancements**: Some pages and components are placeholders and need further functionality.
- **Testing and Optimization**: Needs thorough testing and optimization for better performance.

## Features
- Modern front-end built with React and TypeScript.
- TailwindCSS integration for efficient styling.
- Vite as the build tool for fast development.

## Future Development Needs
- A functional backend system (Node.js, Django, or similar) for seamless data integration.
- Advanced user authentication and database features using Firebase or other platforms.
- Additional UI/UX improvements and responsiveness testing.
